# Madoka-Magica-Frogger

A game made in my first year (second semester) of T163 Game Programming. In a nutshell, this is like the original game Frogger but with a few twists.. There are 5 characters to chose from, each with their own unique abilities. You select one at the start of the game to play as. From there, just like the original, you need to cross a dangerouse randomly generated map to reach one of the "safe zones". Upon reaching the safe zone, you will need to defeat the boss in order to "close the door". Your life span is on a timer, and for each boss you defeat, your remaining life energy will increase.

One thing to note, is the boss fights are rather clunky as, at the time, I didn't realize that you could call the functions through the animations. So, all attacks and animations are done through timers. I've been meaning to change and fix that, but have yet to find the time.
